#Level Design Noodling

Little exercise in design using the Unity 2D game kit

Level Direction:

Since the kit seemed to be built around exploring alien temples, I decided to make a level with a similar theme
except that the temples would be based on these petrified trees that are made from the alien stone blocks. The goal was to create some interesting shapes to platform across,
while progressively harder sequences of spitters shot at you, but I found out that Ellen doesn't do very well when she runs down a diagonal series of blocks. So I scrapped that idea and flattened out the platforming surfaces.
The challenge became a little less coherent, but the main goal now is to immerse the player through some relatively easy platforming and combat setpieces before introducing them to the tree temple. I hope it plays well!

 
 ##Notes from initial tinkering:
 - Laser gun blasts can't destroy destructible tiles, counterintuitive but maybe a gameplay thing?
 - Ellen doesn't handle well with stairs, can be very frustrating when timing a jump off a ledge you think you should be able to jump off of
 - Spitters are cool, they punish you for not moving
 - when placed next to grass, dirt/stone looks like petrified wood, cool aesthetic
